I've recently migrated my site from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. This was long overdue. I've used core migration module to migrate content, the delay is due to make a new theme, I could not decide what to do with the theme. After spending much time on finding a new theme, I finally decided to create a similar theme as previous with some changes. The new theme based on the Foundation framework, while D7 theme was based on adaptive base theme.

I also decided to move the web hosting to Digital Ocean from GoDaddy. I've currently used $5 droplet (the smallest one), the site is running much faster here.
