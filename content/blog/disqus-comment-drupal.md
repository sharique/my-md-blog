Few months back I started using [disqus](https://disqus.com/) commenting system on my site, so far my experience is good. Disqus is very is easy in install and configure. Download and install [disqus module](https://www.drupal.org/project/disqus) from Drupal.org enable it, get api key for your site from Disqus.com and that's it.

For the end user the biggest advantage it that you don't have to create a separate account for each site, you can comment using an existing Disqus account. It really saves a lot of time for the end user as well. Comment moderation is also simple, Disqus has a very nice user interface for moderation.
