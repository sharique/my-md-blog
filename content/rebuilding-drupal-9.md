If you are following Drupal, you might already know that it is much easier to upgrade site to Drupal 9 from Drupal 8 as compared to Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. Yes, that is right.

So why I'm rebuilding site in Drupal 9 instead of upgrading it. There is are multiple reason for it. First things is I want to re-architect my site's content structure, to optimize and make better use of new features of Drupal 9. When I upgraded site from Drupal 7 to 8, I simple run Drupal to Drupal migration. I haven't done anything specific to better utilize Drupal 8 features. Hence some technical bedt is left over that required clean up but unfortunatly, I didn't got time to work on it at that time.

Second reason, I'm implementing CD/CI process to maintain my site. This is the first time I'm trying setup CI/CD process from scratch. I'm using gitlab for this. Gitlab provides amazing set of tools to make it much easier to setup CI/CD.  I'll write a blog post about how I setup this in near future.

For theme, I'm currently using Olivero theme for now, but will create a new theme from scratch.
